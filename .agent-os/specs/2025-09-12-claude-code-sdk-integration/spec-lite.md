# Spec Summary (Lite)

Integrate the official Claude Code TypeScript SDK (`@anthropic/claude-code-sdk`) to power AI orchestration for network diagnostic analysis and safe script generation. The orchestrator runs natively within the Node.js API service, transforming raw device telemetry and diagnostic outputs into actionable insights, proposing remediation steps, and generating shell scripts for device execution after explicit human approval.

Implementation leverages the SDK's built-in streaming (AsyncGenerator), permission controls (`canUseTool` callback), and MCP tool capabilities to create custom network diagnostic tools. This provides a direct integration between the API gateway, device agent, and web portal via WebSocket for real-time approvals, delivering an end-to-end AI-assisted troubleshooting loop with strong safety, auditability, and PII sanitization - all within a single TypeScript/Node.js runtime. No Python sidecar required. The Claude CLI is optional and auto-detected if present; the SDK works directly with ANTHROPIC_API_KEY.
