# Aizen vNE Mission (Lite)

Aizen vNE is an AI-powered Virtual Network Engineer system that helps SMBs and mid-market companies resolve network connectivity, performance, and reachability issues quickly by providing intelligent diagnostics and remediation through plug-and-play Raspberry Pi devices with secure out-of-band cellular connectivity.

Aizen vNE serves small to medium businesses who need rapid network troubleshooting without dedicated IT staff. Unlike traditional network monitoring tools that require complex setup and lose connectivity during outages, Aizen vNE provides plug-and-play deployment with secure cellular communication and AI-guided diagnostics that remain available even during network failures.
