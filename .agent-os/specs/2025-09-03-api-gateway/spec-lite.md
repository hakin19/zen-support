# Spec Summary (Lite)

Implement a Fastify-based API gateway that serves as the central communication hub between device agents and cloud services, handling dual-path authentication for devices (ID/secret) and customers (Supabase Auth). The gateway will provide core API endpoints for device registration, heartbeat, diagnostic commands, and session management, with WebSocket support for real-time bidirectional communication. This establishes the foundational backend layer enabling secure device-to-cloud communication and customer portal access.
