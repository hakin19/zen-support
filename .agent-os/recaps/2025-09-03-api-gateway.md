# 2025-09-03 Recap: API Gateway Implementation

This recaps what was built for the spec documented at .agent-os/specs/2025-09-03-api-gateway/spec.md.

## Recap

Successfully implemented a comprehensive Fastify-based API gateway with complete device and customer authentication systems, command queue management, WebSocket support for real-time communication, and production-ready infrastructure. The implementation delivers a secure, scalable foundation for the Aizen vNE system with full dual-path authentication, robust session management, real-time bidirectional communication, and comprehensive test coverage across all components.

### Completed Features:

- **Fastify server foundation** with ALB-compatible timeout configurations and graceful shutdown
- **Health check endpoints** (/healthz, /readyz, /version) with dependency monitoring for Supabase and Redis
- **Device authentication system** with Redis-based session management and token validation
- **Device registration** with activation code validation and secure device provisioning
- **Command queue system** with claim-based semantics, visibility timeouts, and atomic Redis operations
- **Customer API endpoints** with full CRUD operations for devices and diagnostic sessions
- **Supabase JWT authentication** middleware for customer portal integration
- **Human-in-the-loop approval system** for session management and command approval
- **WebSocket implementation** with dual-path authentication and real-time bidirectional communication
- **WebSocket connection management** with heartbeat/ping-pong and graceful disconnection
- **Request correlation** with X-Request-ID header propagation throughout the system
- **ESM compatibility** fixes and production-grade error handling
- **Comprehensive test coverage** with passing tests for all implemented features

### Technical Achievements:

- **Dual Authentication**: Complete implementation of device ID/secret authentication and customer Supabase JWT validation
- **Customer Endpoints**: Full suite of customer-facing APIs including device management, session creation, and system information
- **Session Management**: Redis-based session storage with TTL refresh and secure token validation
- **Command Queue**: SQS-like command queue with claim semantics, visibility timeouts, and automatic expiry
- **HITL Workflow**: Human-in-the-loop approval system for diagnostic session management
- **WebSocket Support**: Real-time bidirectional communication with authenticated connections for both devices and customers
- **Connection Health**: WebSocket heartbeat mechanism and connection tracking for reliable real-time updates
- **Production Readiness**: Health monitoring, graceful shutdown, and robust error handling

### API Endpoints Implemented:

**Device Endpoints:**

- POST /api/v1/device/auth - Device authentication with session tokens
- POST /api/v1/device/register - Device registration with activation codes
- POST /api/v1/device/commands/claim - Command claiming with visibility timeouts
- POST /api/v1/device/commands/:id/extend - Command lease extension
- POST /api/v1/device/commands/:id/result - Command result submission

**Customer Endpoints:**

- GET /api/v1/customer/devices - List customer devices
- POST /api/v1/customer/devices/provision - Pre-provision new devices
- GET /api/v1/customer/devices/:id/status - Get device status
- POST /api/v1/customer/sessions - Create diagnostic sessions
- GET /api/v1/customer/sessions/:id - Get session details
- POST /api/v1/customer/sessions/:id/approve - HITL session approval
- GET /api/v1/customer/system - Get system information

**WebSocket Endpoints:**

- WS /ws/device - Device WebSocket connections with session token authentication
- WS /ws/customer - Customer WebSocket connections with JWT authentication and room management

### Remaining Work:

The API gateway implementation is now complete with all specified features including WebSocket support. The system provides a production-ready foundation for:

- **AI integration** with Claude SDK for diagnostic analysis (future enhancement)
- **Web portal frontend** integration via existing WebSocket and REST endpoints
- **Enhanced diagnostics** and monitoring capabilities

## Context

Implement a Fastify-based API gateway that serves as the central communication hub between device agents and cloud services, handling dual-path authentication for devices (ID/secret) and customers (Supabase Auth). The gateway provides core API endpoints for device registration, heartbeat, diagnostic commands, and session management, with WebSocket support for real-time bidirectional communication. This establishes the foundational backend layer enabling secure device-to-cloud communication and customer portal access.
