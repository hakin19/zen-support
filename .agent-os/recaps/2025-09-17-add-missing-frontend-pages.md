- **WebSocket for Real-time**: Leveraging existing WebSocket infrastructure for live device status updates
- **Backward Compatibility**: Maintaining API backward compatibility to avoid breaking existing components
- **Role-based Actions**: Implementing role-specific action menus and permissions for user administration

### Development Infrastructure:

**Testing Strategy:**

- Test-first development approach with failing tests written before implementation
- Comprehensive component testing with React Testing Library
- API integration testing with proper mocking and error simulation
- Authentication flow testing with Supabase mock scenarios
- WebSocket event testing with mock subscriptions and event simulation
- User interaction testing with role management and invite workflows
