# Spec Summary (Lite)

Deliver the remaining MVP portal screens so owners and organization admins can manage core Zen workflows inside the product. Ship lightweight dashboard, devices, users, and sessions pages powered by existing Fastify aggregates, reuse Supabase role gating, and keep websocket updates where already available. Provide a single-page organization settings form with billing access and replace the mocked chat store with the real API to persist conversations.
