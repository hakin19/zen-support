# Spec Summary (Lite)

Implement a Next.js 14 web portal with a chat-based interface for natural language network troubleshooting via Claude Code SDK (which is different than Claude SDK) integration. The portal features three-tier role-based access (owner, admin, viewer), device agent management through a Settings menu, and an expandable modal for viewing real-time device actions during chat sessions. Initial MVP focuses on the chat interface and authentication, deferring dashboards and historical analytics for later phases.
