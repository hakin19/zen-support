> Spec: Containerized Device Agent Emulation
> Created: 2025-09-02

## Overview

Implement a containerized Raspberry Pi device agent emulator that simulates the on-premise hardware agent, enabling development and testing of network diagnostic capabilities without physical devices. This foundation will allow rapid iteration on agent functionality while establishing the secure communication patterns required for production deployment.

## User Stories

### Device Agent Simulation

As a developer, I want to run a containerized device agent that simulates a Raspberry Pi, so that I can develop and test network diagnostic features without deploying to physical hardware.

The containerized agent will run in Docker, simulate network interfaces and diagnostic tools, connect to the cloud API via simulated cellular connectivity, and execute diagnostic commands in an isolated environment. This enables the full development workflow including command execution, result collection, and status reporting.

### Network Diagnostics Testing

As a network engineer, I want to execute diagnostic commands through the emulated agent, so that I can verify the system's ability to troubleshoot network issues.

The agent will accept diagnostic requests from the cloud API, execute network diagnostic tools (ping, traceroute, DNS lookups), collect and format results, and return diagnostic data to the cloud API. This validates the core diagnostic workflow end-to-end.

### Multi-Agent Development

As a system architect, I want to run multiple containerized agents simultaneously, so that I can test multi-tenant scenarios and concurrent diagnostic sessions.

Docker Compose will orchestrate multiple agent instances, each with unique device IDs and customer associations, simulating different network conditions and configurations. This ensures the system can handle multiple customers and devices at scale.

## Spec Scope

1. **Docker Container Setup** - Containerized Node.js/TypeScript agent with Raspberry Pi environment simulation
2. **Agent Core Functionality** - Device registration, heartbeat mechanism, and status reporting to cloud API
3. **Network Diagnostic Tools** - Implementation of ping, traceroute, DNS resolution, and connectivity tests
4. **Secure Communication** - Outbound-only HTTPS communication simulating cellular connectivity
5. **Command Execution Framework** - Safe command execution with timeout handling and result transmission

## Out of Scope

- Physical Raspberry Pi deployment
- Actual cellular modem integration
- Production security hardening
- Advanced network diagnostics (bandwidth testing, packet capture)
- Voice interface integration
- Web portal UI for device management

## Expected Deliverable

1. Docker container running device agent that successfully registers with the cloud API and maintains heartbeat
2. Ability to execute basic network diagnostic commands (ping, traceroute, nslookup) through the agent
3. Docker Compose configuration supporting multiple agent instances for multi-tenant testing
