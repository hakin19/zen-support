# Zen & Zen Network Support - Implementation Plan

## Executive Summary

This implementation plan provides a detailed roadmap for building the Zen & Zen Network Support solution - an AI-powered Virtual Network Engineer (vNE) system targeting SMBs. The plan is structured in two major phases:

**POC Development (Phases 100-400)**: Build and validate the complete system in a local Docker environment as a proof of concept, ensuring all core functionality works before cloud deployment.

**MVP Deployment (Phases 500-700)**: Deploy the validated POC to AWS infrastructure as the production-ready MVP with enterprise-grade scalability, security, and operations suitable for customer deployment.

The plan follows the "hands on-prem, brains in-the-cloud" architecture and focuses on achieving <30-minute MTTR for network issues while maintaining enterprise-grade security.

## Project Objectives

- **Primary Goal**: Deliver production MVP that resolves common network issues in <30 minutes
- **Technical Target**: 99%+ uptime, zero data breaches, 4.5+ customer satisfaction
- **Market Target**: IT generalists at SMBs and centralized IT managers of remote branches
