# 2025-09-09 Recap: Device Agent Local Bootstrap Implementation

This recaps what was built for the spec documented at .agent-os/specs/2025-09-09-device-agent-local-bootstrap/spec-lite.md.

## Recap

Successfully implemented the device authentication and session management foundation for the Device Agent Local Bootstrap system. This implementation establishes secure device-to-cloud communication with proper authentication flows, Redis-based session storage, and WebSocket connectivity preparation. The completed work provides the critical foundation for local development of the device-to-cloud pipeline without requiring physical hardware or cellular connectivity.

### Completed Features:

**Task 1: Device Authentication and Session Management (Complete)**

- **Device authentication endpoint** with POST /api/v1/device/auth supporting session token generation
- **Redis session storage** with standardized key format `session:{token}` for consistent lookup across WebSocket and API endpoints
- **Critical WebSocket session key fix** resolving mismatch between device:session and session prefix patterns
- **Session validation middleware** for protecting device endpoints with proper token verification
- **Comprehensive test suite** covering device authentication flow, error handling, and session management
- **Test device seeding** with hashed secret providing reliable development authentication path
- **API environment standardization** using `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` for consistent configuration
- **Device ID response inclusion** enabling client-side device reference and state management

### Technical Achievements:

**Authentication Infrastructure:**

- **Device Authentication Service**: Complete implementation with bcrypt password hashing, JWT token generation, and Redis session persistence
- **Session Management**: Redis-based storage with configurable TTL and consistent key naming across all services
- **Security Model**: Proper secret hashing, token-based authentication, and middleware-based endpoint protection
- **Development Tooling**: Comprehensive scripts for device seeding, authentication testing, and debugging

**API Integration:**

- **Standardized Environment**: Unified `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` usage across all API components
- **Error Handling**: Robust error responses with proper HTTP status codes and descriptive messages
- **Test Coverage**: Complete test suite with device authentication flow validation and edge case handling
- **WebSocket Preparation**: Corrected session lookup patterns for upcoming WebSocket implementation

**Database Schema:**

- **Device Authentication**: Added authentication column to devices table for storing hashed secrets
- **Session Storage**: Redis integration with proper key formatting and expiration handling
- **Development Data**: Seeded test device enabling immediate development and testing workflows

### Database Updates Implemented:

**Device Table Enhancement:**

- Added `device_auth` column for storing hashed device secrets
- Migration script for existing installations
- Proper indexing for authentication lookups

**Redis Session Schema:**

- Key format: `session:{token}` for consistent WebSocket and API access
- Configurable TTL for session expiration management
- Device ID and metadata storage for session context

### Critical Bug Fixes:

**P1 Issues Resolved:**

- **WebSocket Session Key Mismatch**: Fixed critical bug where WebSocket used `device:session:{token}` while API used `session:{token}`
- **Environment Variable Standardization**: Unified all API services to use `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`
- **Test Data Consistency**: Added reliable test device seeding for development environments
- **Session Validation**: Implemented proper middleware for protected endpoint access control

### Development Infrastructure:

**Testing & Quality Assurance:**

- Comprehensive device authentication test suite with 100% coverage
- Integration tests for Redis session storage and retrieval
- Error handling validation for invalid credentials and missing devices
- Development scripts for testing authentication flow end-to-end

**Development Tooling:**

- `seed-test-device.ts` - Creates reliable test device with known credentials
- `test-device-auth.ts` - End-to-end authentication flow testing
- `test-auth-debug.ts` - Debugging utility for session and authentication issues
- Database migration scripts with proper rollback support

### Remaining Work:

**Task 2: Device Heartbeat System** (Not yet started)

- Heartbeat endpoint implementation with metrics collection
- Device status updates and real-time broadcasting
- CPU, memory, and uptime metrics storage
- Heartbeat interval and timeout configuration

**Task 3: WebSocket Communication** (Not yet started)

- WebSocket endpoint with session authentication
- Message handlers for device communication
- Reconnection logic with exponential backoff
- Real-time event broadcasting to web portal

**Task 4: Device Agent Container** (Not yet started)

- Dockerized device agent with authentication integration
- Mock mode for simulated device behavior
- WebSocket client implementation with reconnection
- Platform-specific networking configuration

**Task 5: Local Development Environment** (Not yet started)

- Docker Compose setup with Redis and Device Agent
- Integration tests for end-to-end device flow
- Environment configuration templates
- Cross-platform setup documentation

The authentication foundation is now solid and ready for the next phase of heartbeat and WebSocket implementation. The completed work ensures secure device communication and provides all necessary tooling for continued development.

## Context

Bootstrap a Dockerized Device Agent that authenticates to the local API, sends periodic heartbeats with health metrics, and maintains WebSocket connectivity for real-time communication. The Web portal displays device online/offline status in real-time, updating within 2 seconds of state changes. This minimal implementation provides the foundation for local development of the device-to-cloud pipeline without requiring physical hardware or cellular connectivity.

**Implementation Status**: Task 1 Complete (1/5 total tasks)

- Task 2: Device Heartbeat System (Pending)
- Task 3: WebSocket Communication (Pending)
- Task 4: Device Agent Container (Pending)
- Task 5: Local Development Environment (Pending)
