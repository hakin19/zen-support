# 2025-09-07 Recap: Customer Web Portal Implementation

This recaps what was built for the spec documented at .agent-os/specs/2025-09-07-customer-web-portal/spec.md.

## Recap

Successfully implemented a comprehensive Next.js 14 web portal foundation with Claude Code SDK integration, complete role-based authentication system, and database schema for AI-powered network troubleshooting. The implementation delivers a secure, scalable foundation for natural language network diagnostics with multi-tier access control, device agent management capabilities, and production-ready infrastructure for chat-based interactions.

### Completed Features:

- **Claude Code SDK integration** with comprehensive service wrapper supporting query execution, streaming, JSON responses, and retry logic
- **Advanced prompt template system** with database storage, variable substitution, and fallback mechanisms for AI interactions
- **Three-tier role-based access control** with owner, admin, and viewer roles and organization isolation
- **Complete database schema** with user roles, chat sessions, messages, AI prompts, and device actions tables
- **Row Level Security policies** ensuring proper data isolation and access control across all tables
- **Next.js 14 application foundation** with App Router, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS configuration
- **Supabase authentication integration** with protected routes and middleware-based role checking
- **Responsive sidebar navigation** with Chat and Settings menu items and mobile-friendly design
- **Zustand state management** for client-side application state with TypeScript support
- **Comprehensive test coverage** with passing tests for all components and services

### Technical Achievements:

- **Claude Code SDK Service**: Full-featured service class with streaming support, usage tracking, approval handlers, and prompt template management
- **Authentication Middleware**: Role-based access control with Supabase JWT validation and route protection
- **Database Architecture**: Complete schema with proper foreign keys, constraints, triggers, and automated functions
- **Component Architecture**: Modular React components with TypeScript, proper prop typing, and accessibility features
- **State Management**: Zustand store implementation for global application state management
- **Test Infrastructure**: Comprehensive test suites using Vitest with proper mocking and coverage requirements
- **Development Tooling**: ESLint configuration, Prettier formatting, and development validation pipeline

### Database Schema Implemented:

**Core Tables:**

- `user_roles` - Multi-tenant user access control with owner/admin/viewer roles
- `chat_sessions` - AI conversation sessions with status tracking and metadata
- `chat_messages` - Individual messages with role-based typing and content storage
- `ai_prompts` - Configurable prompt templates with variable substitution
- `device_actions` - Tracking of AI-suggested device operations and approvals

**Advanced Features:**

- Automatic session title generation from first user message
- Session lifecycle management with auto-closure and archiving
- Enforcement of at least one owner per customer organization
- Comprehensive indexing for optimal query performance
- Trigger-based timestamp management and data integrity

### Component Architecture:

**Layout Components:**

- `RootLayout` - Next.js root layout with proper metadata and SEO configuration
- `AppLayout` - Main application wrapper with sidebar and content areas
- `Sidebar` - Responsive navigation with role-based menu items and user information
- `ProtectedRoute` - Authentication wrapper ensuring proper access control

**Authentication System:**

- `AuthProvider` - React context for authentication state management
- `ProtectedRoute` - Component-level route protection with role-based access
- Middleware integration for server-side authentication and route guarding
- Supabase client and server utilities for secure data access

### API Service Layer:

**Claude Code SDK Integration:**

- Complete service wrapper with model selection (Sonnet/Opus)
- Query execution with streaming, JSON parsing, and retry logic
- Prompt template management with database persistence
- Usage tracking with token and cost monitoring
- Device action approval system with human-in-the-loop workflow
- Read-only mode support and tool permission management

**Configuration Management:**

- Environment-based configuration for API keys and settings
- Model and timeout configuration with sensible defaults
- Logging integration with configurable log levels
- Session management for conversation continuity

### Critical Bug Fixes:

**P1 Issues Resolved:**

- **Optional Auth Middleware**: Fixed to properly continue as anonymous instead of blocking requests
- **Database Trigger**: Added migration 006 to fix owner deletion trigger that incorrectly referenced NEW during DELETE operations
- **Test Mock Imports**: Corrected import paths in test files to use proper Supabase client imports

### Remaining Work:

Task 3 (Next.js Web Portal Foundation) is now complete with all 8 subtasks accomplished. The foundation provides a production-ready base for:

- **Chat Interface Implementation** (Task 4) - UI components and WebSocket integration for real-time AI conversations
- **Settings and Admin Features** (Task 5) - User management, device registration, and AI prompt template editor
- **Enhanced AI Integration** with Claude Code SDK for sophisticated network diagnostics and remediation
- **Device Action Modal** for viewing and approving AI-suggested device operations

## Context

Implement a Next.js 14 web portal that provides a chat-based interface for customers to interact with the AI-powered network diagnostics system through Claude Code SDK integration. This portal enables natural language troubleshooting with role-based access control (owner, admin, viewer) and device management capabilities. The implementation establishes the foundational frontend layer with complete authentication, database schema, and AI service integration, enabling secure multi-user access to intelligent network diagnostics and automated remediation capabilities.
