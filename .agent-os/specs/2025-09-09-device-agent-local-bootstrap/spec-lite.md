# Spec Summary (Lite)

Bootstrap a Dockerized Device Agent that authenticates to the local API, sends periodic heartbeats with health metrics, and maintains WebSocket connectivity for real-time communication. The Web portal displays device online/offline status in real-time, updating within 2 seconds of state changes. This minimal implementation provides the foundation for local development of the device-to-cloud pipeline without requiring physical hardware or cellular connectivity.
