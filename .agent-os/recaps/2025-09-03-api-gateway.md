# 2025-09-03 Recap: API Gateway Implementation

This recaps what was built for the spec documented at .agent-os/specs/2025-09-03-api-gateway/spec.md.

## Recap

Successfully implemented the foundation of a Fastify-based API gateway that serves as the central communication hub for the Aizen vNE system. The implementation focuses on production-ready health endpoints, graceful shutdown handling, and stub authentication routes that establish the API structure for future development.

### Completed Features:

- **Fastify server foundation** with ALB-compatible timeout configurations
- **Health check endpoints** (/healthz, /readyz, /version) for ECS integration
- **Dependency health monitoring** for Supabase and Redis connections
- **Request tracking** with X-Request-ID header propagation
- **Graceful shutdown** handling for zero-downtime deployments
- **Device authentication routes** (stubs) establishing the API contract
- **ESM compatibility** fixes and production-grade error handling
- **Comprehensive test coverage** with 22 passing tests

## Context

Implement a Fastify-based API gateway that serves as the central communication hub between device agents and cloud services, handling dual-path authentication for devices (ID/secret) and customers (Supabase Auth). The gateway will provide core API endpoints for device registration, heartbeat, diagnostic commands, and session management, with WebSocket support for real-time bidirectional communication. This establishes the foundational backend layer enabling secure device-to-cloud communication and customer portal access.
