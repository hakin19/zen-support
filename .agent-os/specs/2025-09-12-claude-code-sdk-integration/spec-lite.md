# Spec Summary (Lite)

Integrate the Claude Code SDK to power AI orchestration for network diagnostic analysis and safe script generation. The orchestrator will transform raw device telemetry and diagnostic outputs into actionable insights, propose remediation steps, and generate shell scripts for the device agent to execute after explicit human approval. This feature connects the existing API gateway, device agent, and web portal to deliver an end-to-end AI-assisted troubleshooting loop with strong safety, auditability, and PII sanitization.
