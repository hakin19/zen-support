# 2025-09-07 Recap: Customer Web Portal Implementation

This recaps what was built for the spec documented at .agent-os/specs/2025-09-07-customer-web-portal/spec-lite.md.

## Recap

Successfully implemented foundational backend infrastructure for a Next.js 14 web portal featuring chat-based network troubleshooting through Claude Code SDK integration. The implementation establishes complete database schema for three-tier role-based access (owner, admin, viewer), Claude Code SDK service integration with AI-powered network diagnostics, and comprehensive authentication middleware. This backend foundation provides the secure, scalable infrastructure necessary for the customer web portal's natural language troubleshooting capabilities.

### Completed Features:

- **Claude Code SDK Integration** with comprehensive service wrapper and prompt template management
- **Database Schema Implementation** with complete migration set for user roles, chat sessions, and AI device interactions
- **Authentication Middleware** with role-based access control and web portal specific authentication
- **Row Level Security Policies** for secure multi-tenant data access across all portal tables
- **AI Prompt Management System** for customizable diagnostic templates and responses
- **Device Action Tracking** with complete audit trail for AI-suggested remediation actions
- **Chat Message Persistence** with session management and message history storage
- **Type Safety** with generated TypeScript types from updated database schema
- **Comprehensive Test Coverage** with passing tests for all implemented backend components

### Technical Achievements:

- **Claude Code SDK Service**: Complete integration with Claude Code SDK for AI-powered network diagnostics and analysis
- **Multi-Tier Role System**: Database-backed user role management supporting owner, admin, and viewer access levels
- **Chat Infrastructure**: Complete backend support for persistent chat sessions with message threading
- **AI Action Framework**: Database structure for tracking AI-suggested device actions with approval workflows
- **Security Implementation**: Row Level Security policies ensuring proper tenant isolation and role-based data access
- **Middleware Layer**: Authentication middleware specifically designed for web portal access patterns
- **Database Migrations**: Complete set of migrations establishing all necessary tables and relationships
- **Type Generation**: Updated TypeScript types reflecting new database schema for type-safe development

### Database Schema Implemented:

**User Management:**

- `user_roles` - Three-tier role system (owner, admin, viewer) with customer association

**Chat System:**

- `chat_sessions` - Persistent chat sessions with user and device context
- `chat_messages` - Message storage with role tracking and timestamp ordering

**AI Integration:**

- `ai_prompts` - Customizable prompt templates for different diagnostic scenarios
- `device_actions` - AI-suggested actions with approval workflow and execution tracking

**Security Infrastructure:**

- Complete RLS policies for all new tables ensuring proper tenant isolation
- Role-based access controls enforced at database level

### API Infrastructure:

**Authentication Layer:**

- Web portal specific authentication middleware with role validation
- Integration with existing Supabase authentication system
- Session management for portal-specific access patterns

**Claude Code SDK Integration:**

- Service wrapper with error handling and retry logic
- Prompt template system for consistent AI interactions
- Integration with existing device communication infrastructure

### Remaining Work:

The backend infrastructure is now complete for the customer web portal. The next phase involves frontend implementation:

- **Next.js 14 Portal** with React components and Tailwind CSS styling
- **Chat Interface** connecting to the established backend chat infrastructure
- **Settings Management** utilizing the role-based access system
- **Real-time Features** leveraging existing WebSocket infrastructure for live chat updates

## Context

Implement a Next.js 14 web portal with a chat-based interface for natural language network troubleshooting via Claude Code SDK integration. The portal features three-tier role-based access (owner, admin, viewer), device agent management through a Settings menu, and an expandable modal for viewing real-time device actions during chat sessions. Initial MVP focuses on the chat interface and authentication, deferring dashboards and historical analytics for later phases.
