# Task 4 Completion Recap

## Summary
Successfully completed Task 4: Build Device Agent Container

## What Was Done

### 4.1 Device Agent Authentication and Heartbeat Tests
- Created comprehensive test suite in `device-auth.test.ts`
- Tests cover authentication, heartbeat, session management, and performance requirements

### 4.2 Dockerfile Review and Update
- Updated Dockerfile from Debian to Alpine Linux (reduced image size)
- Added security settings and non-root user
- Configured health checks and environment variables
- Created production-optimized `Dockerfile.prod` for faster builds

### 4.3 Mock Mode Implementation
- Implemented `MockDeviceSimulator` class for simulated device behavior
- Generates realistic network diagnostics output (ping, traceroute, DNS, etc.)
- Simulates changing metrics (CPU, memory, network latency)

### 4.4 WebSocket Client Implementation
- Created `WebSocketClient` with reconnection logic and exponential backoff
- Integrated with authentication system using session tokens
- Added message queueing for offline resilience

### 4.5 Environment Configuration
- Updated `.env.example` with all required variables
- Enhanced `ConfigLoader` to support all device agent settings
- Added fallback defaults for robust operation

### 4.6 Platform-Specific Networking
- Added `host.docker.internal` support for Mac/Windows
- Documented Linux workaround with `--add-host=host.docker.internal:host-gateway`
- Created Docker networking documentation

### 4.7 Build Verification
- Fixed TypeScript compilation errors:
  - Corrected API endpoints (`/api/v1/device/auth`, `/api/v1/device/heartbeat`)
  - Updated type definitions to match actual API responses
  - Removed unused variables and fixed type mismatches
- Successfully built TypeScript (`npm run build`)
- Successfully built Docker container (`device-agent:prod`)

## Key Fixes Applied

1. **API Endpoint Corrections**:
   - Changed `/auth/device` to `/api/v1/device/auth`
   - Changed `/devices/heartbeat` to `/api/v1/device/heartbeat`

2. **Type Definition Updates**:
   - Updated `AuthResponse` to match API: `{ token, expiresIn, deviceId }`
   - Updated `HeartbeatRequest` to match API: `{ status: 'healthy' | 'degraded' | 'offline', metrics }`
   - Updated `HeartbeatResponse` to match API: `{ success, timestamp }`

3. **Authentication Flow**:
   - Fixed request body to use `deviceId` and `deviceSecret` (not snake_case)
   - Updated to use `Authorization: Bearer` header (API accepts both this and `X-Device-Token`)
   - Removed refresh token logic (not supported by current API)

4. **Build Issues**:
   - Created simplified `Dockerfile.prod` to avoid npm install timeout issues
   - Built production image successfully (152MB, Alpine-based)

## Docker Image Details
- Image: `device-agent:prod`
- Size: 152MB
- Base: `node:20-alpine`
- Includes: Network diagnostic tools (ping, traceroute, dig, etc.)
- Security: Non-root user, health checks

## Next Steps
Task 5: Create Local Development Environment is ready to begin. All prerequisites from Task 4 are now complete.
