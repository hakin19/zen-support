The authentication, heartbeat, and WebSocket communication foundations are now complete and provide a robust, production-ready foundation for device-to-cloud communication. The implemented WebSocket infrastructure supports full bidirectional communication with proper error handling, backpressure management, and comprehensive testing coverage. This provides all necessary tooling and infrastructure for the next phase of Device Agent Container implementation.

## Context

Bootstrap a Dockerized Device Agent that authenticates to the local API, sends periodic heartbeats with health metrics, and maintains WebSocket connectivity for real-time communication. The Web portal displays device online/offline status in real-time, updating within 2 seconds of state changes. This minimal implementation provides the foundation for local development of the device-to-cloud pipeline without requiring physical hardware or cellular connectivity.

## Updates (2025-09-11): E2E Integration Fixes and API Additions

- Root cause of device E2E failures: global test mocks in `test/setup.ts` intercepted Supabase client calls, returning undefined instead of `{ data, error }`. Resolution: added integration-only Vitest config and setup with real clients.
  - Added `test/setup.integration.ts` and `vitest.config.integration.ts`; integration tests now bypass global mocks.
  - `.env.test` updated to `REDIS_PORT=6379` and Fastify set to `^4.28.1` for WS plugin compatibility.
- Authentication and headers:
  - Device middleware now prioritizes `X-Device-Session` over `X-Device-Token` and `Authorization`.
  - Session tokens switched to 64-char hex (`randomBytes(32)`), aligned with device agent/tests.
- Heartbeat semantics:
  - Heartbeat schema accepts `'online'` in addition to `'healthy'|'degraded'|'offline'`.
  - Service maps `'healthy'` or `'online'` heartbeats to connectivity `'online'` and stores metrics.
- WebSocket hardening and status:
  - Robust connection extraction for Fastify+WS plugin variants; guards missing `.on`.
  - On device WS close, API updates device status to `'offline'` with `last_seen`.
  - DeviceAgent health status now reports `websocket: 'connected'|'disconnected'`.
- New device command REST endpoints (complement WS flow):
  - `POST /api/v1/device/commands` queues a command, immediately claims to issue `claimToken`, and publishes WS control message.
  - `GET /api/v1/device/commands/:id` returns command status/result (includes `result.success`).
- Supabase REST in tests:
  - E2E reads use `apikey` and `Authorization: Bearer` with `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` due to RLS on `devices`.
- Outcome: all 13 Device E2E tests now pass via `npm run test:integration:vitest`.

Next steps: stabilize web package unit test timings around WS client, add lightweight docs for the new device command endpoints, and consider a dedicated status read API to avoid direct REST reads in tests.
