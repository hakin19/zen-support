- Task 2: Organization Settings MVP ✅ (Completed 2025-09-17)
- Task 3: Device Management Basics ✅ (Completed 2025-09-17)
- Task 4: User Administration Basics ⏳ (Pending)
- Task 5: Sessions Queue & Approvals ⏳ (Pending)
- Task 6: Chat Persistence ⏳ (Pending)
- Task 7: QA & Documentation ⏳ (Pending)

**Test Coverage Implemented:**

- **Authentication Tests**: Verification that settings page blocks rendering until Supabase hydration completes
- **Form Validation Tests**: Comprehensive testing of all validation rules, required fields, and format validation
- **API Integration Tests**: Mock API testing for successful updates, error handling, and authentication flow
- **Component Tests**: React Testing Library tests covering user interactions, form submission, and error states

**Architectural Foundations:**

- **Settings Page Structure**: Established `/settings/organization` route with proper layout integration and navigation
- **Device Management Structure**: Established `/devices` route with comprehensive device management capabilities
- **Form Component Architecture**: Reusable form patterns that can be extended for additional settings pages
- **API Integration Patterns**: Standardized patterns for authenticated API calls that can be reused across portal pages
- **Error Handling Standards**: Consistent error handling approach for API failures and validation errors
- **WebSocket Patterns**: Reusable WebSocket subscription patterns for real-time updates across the portal

### Critical Design Decisions:

**P1 Architecture Choices:**

- **Single-Page Settings**: Keeping organization settings on one page rather than multi-step wizard for MVP simplicity
- **Real-time Validation**: Immediate field validation feedback rather than submit-time validation for better UX
- **Billing Portal Integration**: Using Stripe's hosted portal rather than building custom billing UI for security and compliance
- **Form Auto-save**: Immediate submission on field changes rather than explicit save button for streamlined experience
- **Table-based Device View**: Using table layout for device listing rather than card view for information density
- **WebSocket for Real-time**: Leveraging existing WebSocket infrastructure for live device status updates
- **Backward Compatibility**: Maintaining API backward compatibility to avoid breaking existing components

### Development Infrastructure:

**Testing Strategy:**

- Test-first development approach with failing tests written before implementation
- Comprehensive component testing with React Testing Library
- API integration testing with proper mocking and error simulation
- Authentication flow testing with Supabase mock scenarios
- WebSocket event testing with mock subscriptions and event simulation

**Code Quality:**

- Full TypeScript coverage with strict type checking for all form data and API responses
- ESLint compliance with auto-fix integration and consistent code formatting
- Component documentation with clear props interfaces and usage examples
- Responsive design testing across mobile and desktop breakpoints
- Accessibility testing including ARIA labels, keyboard navigation, and screen reader support

## Context

Deliver the remaining MVP portal screens so owners and organization admins can manage core Zen workflows inside the product. Ship lightweight dashboard, devices, users, and sessions pages powered by existing Fastify aggregates, reuse Supabase role gating, and keep websocket updates where already available. Provide a single-page organization settings form with billing access and replace the mocked chat store with the real API to persist conversations.
