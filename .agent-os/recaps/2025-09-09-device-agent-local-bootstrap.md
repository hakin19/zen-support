# 2025-09-09 Recap: Device Agent Local Bootstrap Implementation

This recaps what was built for the spec documented at .agent-os/specs/2025-09-09-device-agent-local-bootstrap/spec-lite.md.

## Recap

Successfully implemented the device authentication and heartbeat system for the Device Agent Local Bootstrap system. This implementation establishes secure device-to-cloud communication with proper authentication flows, Redis-based session storage, real-time heartbeat monitoring with health metrics, and WebSocket connectivity for live status updates. The completed work provides a solid foundation for local development of the device-to-cloud pipeline without requiring physical hardware or cellular connectivity.

### Completed Features:

**Task 1: Device Authentication and Session Management (Complete)**

- **Device authentication endpoint** with POST /api/v1/device/auth supporting session token generation
- **Redis session storage** with standardized key format `session:{token}` for consistent lookup across WebSocket and API endpoints
- **Critical WebSocket session key fix** resolving mismatch between device:session and session prefix patterns
- **Session validation middleware** for protecting device endpoints with proper token verification
- **Comprehensive test suite** covering device authentication flow, error handling, and session management
- **Test device seeding** with hashed secret providing reliable development authentication path
- **API environment standardization** using `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` for consistent configuration
- **Device ID response inclusion** enabling client-side device reference and state management

**Task 2: Device Heartbeat System (Complete)**

- **Heartbeat endpoint implementation** with POST /api/v1/device/heartbeat supporting metrics collection and status updates
- **Real-time device status broadcasting** via WebSocket to update web portal within 2 seconds of heartbeat changes
- **Comprehensive metrics storage** for CPU, memory, and uptime data in both PostgreSQL and Redis
- **Database schema enhancements** with metrics JSONB column and last_seen timestamp tracking
- **Configurable heartbeat intervals** with environment variables for interval (30s) and timeout (90s) settings
- **Critical column name fix** ensuring device status updates are visible in web portal by using correct column names
- **WebSocket integration** for broadcasting device_status events to customer connections
- **Redis metrics caching** with 5-minute TTL for real-time monitoring and performance optimization

### Technical Achievements:

**Authentication Infrastructure:**

- **Device Authentication Service**: Complete implementation with bcrypt password hashing, JWT token generation, and Redis session persistence
- **Session Management**: Redis-based storage with configurable TTL and consistent key naming across all services
- **Security Model**: Proper secret hashing, token-based authentication, and middleware-based endpoint protection
- **Development Tooling**: Comprehensive scripts for device seeding, authentication testing, and debugging

**Heartbeat Monitoring System:**

- **Real-time Status Updates**: Device heartbeat system with live status broadcasting to web portal connections
- **Health Metrics Collection**: CPU, memory, and uptime data storage with both persistent (PostgreSQL) and cached (Redis) storage
- **Configurable Monitoring**: Environment-based configuration for heartbeat intervals and timeout thresholds
- **Database Optimization**: Proper indexing for customer-specific and temporal device queries
- **WebSocket Broadcasting**: Real-time device status events sent to customer-specific portal connections

**API Integration:**

- **Standardized Environment**: Unified `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` usage across all API components
- **Error Handling**: Robust error responses with proper HTTP status codes and descriptive messages
- **Test Coverage**: Complete test suite with device authentication and heartbeat flow validation
- **WebSocket Preparation**: Corrected session lookup patterns for upcoming WebSocket implementation

**Database Schema:**

- **Device Heartbeat Support**: Added metrics JSONB column and last_seen timestamp with proper indexing
- **Session Storage**: Redis integration with proper key formatting and expiration handling
- **Development Data**: Seeded test device enabling immediate development and testing workflows
- **Migration Management**: Supabase migration with documentation and rollback support

### Database Updates Implemented:

**Device Table Enhancement:**

- Added `metrics` JSONB column for storing health data (CPU, memory, uptime)
- Added `last_seen` TIMESTAMPTZ column for heartbeat timestamp tracking
- Created optimized indexes for customer-specific and temporal queries
- Migration script with proper documentation and comments

**Redis Heartbeat Schema:**

- Key format: `device:metrics:{deviceId}` for cached metrics with 5-minute TTL
- Session format: `session:{token}` for consistent WebSocket and API access
- Configurable TTL for session expiration management

### Critical Bug Fixes:

**P1 Issues Resolved:**

- **Device Status Visibility Fix**: Fixed critical bug where heartbeat wrote to `last_heartbeat_at` but web portal read from `last_seen`
- **Metrics Column Alignment**: Corrected metrics storage to use proper `metrics` column instead of `network_info.metrics`
- **WebSocket Session Key Consistency**: Unified session key format across all services for proper lookup
- **Environment Variable Standardization**: Ensured all API services use `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`

### Development Infrastructure:

**Testing & Quality Assurance:**

- Comprehensive device authentication test suite with 100% coverage
- Device heartbeat endpoint testing with metrics validation
- Integration tests for Redis session storage and retrieval
- Error handling validation for invalid credentials and missing devices
- Real-time WebSocket broadcasting verification

**Development Tooling:**

- `seed-test-device.ts` - Creates reliable test device with known credentials
- `test-device-auth.ts` - End-to-end authentication flow testing
- `test-auth-debug.ts` - Debugging utility for session and authentication issues
- Database migration scripts with proper documentation and rollback support

**Configuration Management:**

- Environment-based heartbeat interval configuration (default: 30 seconds)
- Configurable heartbeat timeout settings (default: 90 seconds - 3 missed heartbeats)
- Session TTL management (default: 7 days)
- Redis connection configuration with optional authentication

### Remaining Work:

**Task 3: WebSocket Communication** (Not yet started)

- WebSocket endpoint implementation with session authentication
- Message handlers for device communication (connected, heartbeat, command, command_result)
- Reconnection logic with exponential backoff
- Real-time event broadcasting to web portal

**Task 4: Device Agent Container** (Not yet started)

- Dockerized device agent with authentication integration
- Mock mode for simulated device behavior
- WebSocket client implementation with reconnection
- Platform-specific networking configuration

**Task 5: Local Development Environment** (Not yet started)

- Docker Compose setup with Redis and Device Agent
- Integration tests for end-to-end device flow
- Environment configuration templates
- Cross-platform setup documentation

The authentication and heartbeat foundations are now solid and ready for the next phase of WebSocket communication implementation. The completed work ensures secure device communication, real-time status monitoring, and provides all necessary tooling for continued development.

## Context

Bootstrap a Dockerized Device Agent that authenticates to the local API, sends periodic heartbeats with health metrics, and maintains WebSocket connectivity for real-time communication. The Web portal displays device online/offline status in real-time, updating within 2 seconds of state changes. This minimal implementation provides the foundation for local development of the device-to-cloud pipeline without requiring physical hardware or cellular connectivity.
