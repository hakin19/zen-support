# Spec Summary (Lite)

Integrate the Claude Code SDK to power AI orchestration for network diagnostic analysis and safe script generation. The orchestrator will transform raw device telemetry and diagnostic outputs into actionable insights, propose remediation steps, and generate shell scripts for the device agent to execute after explicit human approval. Implementation uses the official Claude Code SDK (Python) with the Claude Code CLI installed, running as a sidecar service (tools disabled by default). This connects the API gateway, device agent, and web portal to deliver an end-to-end AI-assisted troubleshooting loop with strong safety, auditability, and PII sanitization.
