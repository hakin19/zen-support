# 2025-09-12 Recap: Claude Code SDK Integration for AI Orchestration

This recaps what was built for the spec documented at .agent-os/specs/2025-09-12-claude-code-sdk-integration/spec-lite.md.

## Recap

Successfully designed and documented a comprehensive AI orchestration system using the official Claude Code TypeScript SDK (`@anthropic/claude-code-sdk`) for network diagnostic analysis and safe script generation. This specification represents a major architectural simplification by eliminating the need for a Python sidecar service and enabling native TypeScript integration directly within the Node.js API service. The design establishes a complete human-in-the-loop workflow where AI analyzes device diagnostics, proposes remediation scripts, and executes them only after explicit customer approval through the web portal.

### Completed Features:

- **Analysis prompt templates with TypeScript interfaces** designed for diagnostic analysis, root cause identification, and remediation recommendations
- **SDK Options interface with safety defaults** configured for analysis-only mode with `allowedTools: []` by default, enabling specific tools only after security review
- **MCP tool schemas using Zod for type safety** providing runtime validation for all AI-generated outputs and tool parameters
- **Permission system architecture** leveraging SDK's `canUseTool` callback for seamless HITL approval workflow integration
- **Streaming response patterns** using AsyncGenerator for real-time analysis updates to the web portal

**Specification Documentation (Complete)**

## Context

Integrate the official Claude Code TypeScript SDK (`@anthropic/claude-code-sdk`) to power AI orchestration for network diagnostic analysis and safe script generation. The orchestrator runs natively within the Node.js API service, transforming raw device telemetry and diagnostic outputs into actionable insights, proposing remediation steps, and generating shell scripts for device execution after explicit human approval.

Implementation leverages the SDK's built-in streaming (AsyncGenerator), permission controls (`canUseTool` callback), and MCP tool capabilities to create custom network diagnostic tools. This provides a direct integration between the API gateway, device agent, and web portal via WebSocket for real-time approvals, delivering an end-to-end AI-assisted troubleshooting loop with strong safety, auditability, and PII sanitization - all within a single TypeScript/Node.js runtime.
