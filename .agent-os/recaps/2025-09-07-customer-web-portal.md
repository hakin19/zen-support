- `MessageList` - Scrollable message display with proper message bubbles and timestamps
- `MessageInput` - Chat input with send functionality and typing indicators
- `DeviceActionModal` - Expandable modal showing real-time AI command execution
- `ActionApprovalButton` - Human-in-the-loop approval interface for device actions

**Authentication System:**

- `AuthProvider` - React context for authentication state management
- `ProtectedRoute` - Component-level route protection with role-based access
- Middleware integration for server-side authentication and route guarding
- Supabase client and server utilities for secure data access

### API Service Layer:

**Claude Code SDK Integration:**

### Remaining Work:

**Task 6: Settings and Admin Features** (Not yet started)

- User management interface (list, invite, role assignment)
- Device registration and configuration UI
- AI prompt template editor (owner-only with Monaco editor)
- Organization settings management
- Role-based visibility controls

The core web portal is now fully functional with complete chat interface, real-time AI integration, and device action management. Task 6 represents the administrative features that would enhance the portal with user and device management capabilities.

## Context

Implement a Next.js 14 web portal with a chat-based interface for natural language network troubleshooting via Claude Code SDK integration. The portal features three-tier role-based access (owner, admin, viewer), device agent management through a Settings menu, and an expandable modal for viewing real-time device actions during chat sessions. Initial MVP focuses on the chat interface and authentication, deferring dashboards and historical analytics for later phases.
