## Pitch

Aizen vNE is an AI-powered Virtual Network Engineer system that helps SMBs and mid-market companies resolve network connectivity, performance, and reachability issues quickly by providing intelligent diagnostics and remediation through plug-and-play Raspberry Pi devices with secure out-of-band cellular connectivity.

## Users

### Primary Customers

- **Small to Medium Businesses (SMBs)**: Organizations with 10-200 employees who lack dedicated IT staff but require reliable network infrastructure
- **Mid-market Companies**: Growing businesses with limited IT resources who need rapid network troubleshooting capabilities

### User Personas

**IT Manager** (35-50 years old)

- **Role:** IT Manager or Office Manager with IT responsibilities
- **Context:** Manages technology for a growing business without a full IT team
- **Pain Points:** Network outages cause productivity loss, expensive technician visits, lack of network visibility
- **Goals:** Quick issue resolution, reduced downtime, cost-effective network management

**Business Owner** (30-55 years old)

- **Role:** Small business owner or operations manager
- **Context:** Relies on technology for daily operations but has limited technical expertise
- **Pain Points:** Network issues disrupt business operations, difficulty finding reliable IT support, high costs for emergency service calls
- **Goals:** Reliable network connectivity, minimal business disruption, predictable IT costs

## The Problem

### Network Downtime Crisis

Network connectivity issues can cost SMBs $1,000-$5,000 per hour in lost productivity and revenue. Most small businesses lack the expertise to quickly diagnose and resolve network problems, leading to extended outages while waiting for external IT support.

**Our Solution:** Aizen vNE provides instant AI-powered network diagnostics and guided remediation through an on-premise device that connects directly to cloud-based AI services.

### Lack of Network Visibility

Small businesses often have no insight into their network performance until problems occur. Traditional monitoring tools are complex and expensive, designed for enterprises with dedicated IT staff.

**Our Solution:** Our system provides continuous network monitoring with user-friendly dashboards and proactive issue detection.

### Expensive Emergency IT Support

Emergency IT service calls can cost $150-$300 per hour, with additional charges for after-hours support. Many issues that require expensive technician visits could be resolved remotely with proper diagnostics.

**Our Solution:** AI-guided diagnostics enable most network issues to be resolved without costly on-site visits.

## Differentiators

### Plug-and-Play AI Network Engineer

Unlike traditional network monitoring tools that require complex setup and ongoing management, Aizen vNE works out-of-the-box with a simple Raspberry Pi device that connects via cellular. This provides immediate network intelligence without requiring IT expertise.

### Secure Out-of-Band Management

Unlike cloud-only solutions that lose connectivity during network outages, our hybrid architecture maintains communication through cellular connectivity. This ensures diagnostics and remediation capabilities remain available even during primary network failures.

### Human-in-the-Loop AI Safety

Unlike fully automated systems that might cause additional network disruption, Aizen vNE requires human approval for all remediation actions while providing AI-powered guidance and analysis. This combines AI intelligence with human oversight for safe network management.
